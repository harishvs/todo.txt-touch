# Todo.txt Touch

An Android application by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org) and [the Todo.txt community](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/todotxt/) designed to manage your [todo.txt file](http://todotxt.com) stored in [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com).

[Purchase Todo.txt Touch in the Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.todotxt.todotxttouch) or [download the apk](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-touch/downloads), but be aware this app is in development and there are several [known bugs and todo items](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-touch/issues). 

Todo.txt Touch requires that you have a Dropbox account in order to be able to capture the todo.txt file elsewhere than just on your Android device.  Eventually, we hope to support other cloud sources.

There are already a multitude of decent task managers for Android, but Todo.txt Touch is a minimalist, plain-text focused solution we built to learn by collaborating on Android development.
